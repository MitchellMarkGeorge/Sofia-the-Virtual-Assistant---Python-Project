# Sofia-the-Virtual-Assistant---Python-Project
 For this project, I used two API's : the Wolfram Aplpha API and the Wikipedia and the wxPython framework to create a highly intelligent GUI Desktop assistant. 
 This application can answer questions ranging from simple math calculations to questions about the known universe (just to give specfic examples). 
 The application can also bring up information on people or evnts and can even list word deffinitions! 
 I do plan on implementing more amazing features to this project (like speach  recocgnition or more funtionality). 
 Any suggestions are welcome!
